0.Basic effect: Deal 2 damage to 1 target you can see that is not on your square. Then you may move the target 1 square.
1.@|bold,blue █ |@ With rocket jump: Move 1 or 2 squares. This effect can be used either before or after the basic effect.
2.@|bold,yellow █ |@ With fragmenting warhead: During the basic effect, deal 1 damage to every player on your target's original square – including the target, even if you move it.
Notes: If you use the rocket jump before the basic effect, you consider only your new square when determining if a target is legal.
       You can even move off a square so you can shoot someone on it.
       If you use the fragmenting warhead, you deal damage to everyone on the target's square before you move the target – your target will take 3 damage total.
