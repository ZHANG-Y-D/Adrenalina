0.basic effect: Choose 1 or 2 targets you can see and deal 1 damage to each.
1.@|bold,yellow █ |@with focus shot: Deal 1 additional damage to one of those targets.
2.@|bold,blue █ |@with turret tripod: Deal 1 additional damage to the other of those targets and/or deal 1 damage to a different target you can see.
Notes: If you deal both additional points of damage,they must be dealt to 2 different targets. If you see only
       2 targets, you deal 2 to each if you use both optional effects. If you use the basic effect on only 1 target, you can still use the the turret tripod to give it 1 additional damage.
